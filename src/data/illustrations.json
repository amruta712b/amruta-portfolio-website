    "Description": "Neelkanth left home with only a few possessions: a loin cloth, a small scripture, a murti, and a begging bowl.  He traveled with only what was necessary, renounced His family and other worldly possessions, and continued His lifelong journey of bringing people closer to God. While traveling through the Himalayas, Neelkanth endured the severe climate of the coldest months of the year, a time when even the residents of the Himalayas migrate to warmer temperatures.  Despite the physical challenges, Neelkanth climbed a height of 12,500 feet to arrive at the revered mandir dedicated to Vishnu, Muktinath.  Here, He spent four months engaged in penance despite harsh temperatures, freezing rainfall, and piercing winds.",
